<h1>Notes</h1>

<p>HTML is an acronym for Hypertext Markup Language. HTML5 was created in order to enable a variety of features that current websites need. HTML5 is simple to implement since there are no substantial changes to the HTML programming paradigm. HTML5 is also backward compatible with older browsers. I mention backward compatibility since HTML5 was built in such a manner that browsers that donâ€™t support it may disregard these constructs.</p>
